# Azheimer-s-Classification-using-EEG-SignalP
The project aim is to design a non-invasive diagnosis tool for Alzheimer's disease using software implementation in MATLAB and Python.
Preprocessing was done using signal processing algorithms and filtering the data.
Data segmentation was done using FFT and obtaining the beta and theta sub-bands of the data.
KNN and SVM algorithms were used to classify the data.
